Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a researcher at [Samsung Research Philippines](https://research.samsung.com/srph) where I specialize in NLP problems constrained under low-resource settings.

My research interests revolve around creative approaches to solve NLP tasks with very little data. Topics I have worked on range from NLI to fake news detection, all done within the scope of low-resource languages.

Given that my native tongue -- Filipino -- is a low-resource language, I spend time to develop and open-source datasets and models to boost research in this area. Do check out my [Resources](/resources) tab if you're interested in pretrained models and benchmark datasets for my language! My Filipino transformer models are also available on ðŸ¤— [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) under my username [`jcblaise`](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise).

Aside from my work at Samsung, I'm also affiliated with the [DLSU Center for Language Technologies](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/adric/celt/) (CELT) where I serve as a consultant for dialogue generation research projects. Prior to CELT, I also spent time with [Senti AI](https://senti.ai) and [DLSU COMET](https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/) working on conversational agents and machine learning.

If you're interested in collaborating or if you want to chat about low-resource languages, feel free to get in touch! You may reach me through my email `me (at) blaisecruz (dot) com`.
