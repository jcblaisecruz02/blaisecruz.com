Mabuhay! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a researcher at [Samsung Research Philippines](https://research.samsung.com/srph) where I specialize in NLP problems at the intersection of multilinguality and low-resource languages.

My research interests revolve around creative approaches to solve NLP problems constrained by minimal data. Topics I have worked on encompass a wide variety of tasks such as fake news detection, multilingual translation, language modeling, and linguistic code-switching â€” all done within the scope of low-resource languages.

Given that my native tongue â€” Filipino â€” is a low-resource language, I spend time to develop and open-source datasets and models to boost research in this area. Do check out my [Resources](/resources) tab if you're interested in pretrained models and benchmark datasets for my language! My Filipino transformer models are also available on ðŸ¤— [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) under my username [`jcblaise`](https://huggingface.co/jcblaise).

Aside from my work at Samsung, I am also a lecturer at the [University of the Philippines - Diliman](https://eee.upd.edu.ph/), as well as a research consultant for the [DLSU Center for Language Technologies](https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/research/research-centers/adric/celt/) (CELT) where I advise graduate students on dialogue generation research. Prior to this, I also spent time with [Senti AI](https://senti.ai) and [DLSU COMET](https://comet.dlsu.edu.ph/) working on conversational agents and machine learning.

If you're interested in collaborating or if you want to chat about low-resource languages, feel free to get in touch! You may reach me through my email `me (at) blaisecruz (dot) com`.
